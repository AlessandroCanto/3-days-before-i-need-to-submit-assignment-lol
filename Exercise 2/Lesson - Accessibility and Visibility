When declaring fields and methods, it's important to keep track of what modifier is being used because
its accessibility and functionality changes.

Access Modifiers -
Public: anywhere in the program
Private: within the class 
Protected: within the class and its subclasses
No Modifier: only within package

Non Access Modifiers - 
Final: renders variables/methods unchangeable
Static: makes it independent of instance creation

This is applicable in the creation of fields and methods results because some of them shouldn't be easily modifiable.
