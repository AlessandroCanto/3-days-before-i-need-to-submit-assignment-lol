//Creating a class and basics
public class Main {
  /*create class "Main"
  important elements of a class are that it contains fields and methods 
  Fields store data points corresponding to class 
  Behaviors are actions that can be responded or reciprocate to events/inputs.
  */
  
  int x = 5; //creates x field with a value of 5
  
  public static void main(String[] args) {
     //the entry point of program meaning everything within this code will be executed at first. 
     Main obj = new Main() //instantiates object 
     system.out.println(obj.x) //test and it should print the number 5 
  }
   
}

/*Further Thinking
create a new class named whatever you want 
add 5 different number field names. 
After making the object, calculate its sum by refercing the class' fields in print statement.
