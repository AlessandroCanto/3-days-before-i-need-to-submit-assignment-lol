Benefits of OOP Programming: 
- faster to execute 
- provides structure to code (reduces redundancy)
- easier to modify, create and debug 

A class is a template consisting of data fields and behaviors. 
The object-oriented nature derives from when a class is created, it creates an instance of the class which is known as an object. 


In order to make a class in Java, it follows a simple strucutre:
modifier (accessibility and visibility)  + "class" keyword (classifies it as a class)

To create an object (instance of class): 
type of object (class name) + name object = new (operator) + class declaration (potential arguments)

You can have an unlimited number of classes and instances of corresponding class. However, an abudance of repetive declaration conflicts with the purpose
of streamlining the process with OOP.
